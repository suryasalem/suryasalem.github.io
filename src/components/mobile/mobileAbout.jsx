                Hi, I'm Surya <br />
                <br />
                I recently graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in
                Computer Science specializing in Software Engineering, Machine
                Learning, and Artificial Intelligence with a Minor in
                Management. During my time at Purdue, I have been involved in
                The Data Mine, a learning community partnering with corporations
                to work on year-long projects, as well as various clubs. I was
                also the co-founder and VPI of the Association of South Asians
                at Purdue (ASAP). <br />
                <br />
                In my free time, I enjoy photography, dancing, and gaming. When
                I was at Purdue, I was in a group called ADVNT, a
                pre-professional dance organization that performed at showcases
                and competitions throughout the Midwest. At my last performance
                with the team, we won 2nd place at IndyOpen â€˜24. I also game
                casually to stay in touch with many of my friends.
